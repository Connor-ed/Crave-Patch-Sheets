# The Crave Patch Project

I got the Behringer Crave a few months ago, and I was having a hard time finding patch sheets that were easy to understand. I decided to make this little Web App using [GDevelop5](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop) to easily create simple sheets that can be replicated at a glance. This is still early in development, so a few basic features are still missing. If you make something you want to share, I provided a link below to upload screenshots of your creations.
